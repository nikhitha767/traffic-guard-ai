## Developer Guide: Setting up Environment & Data Files

Since this project handles sensitive data and large files, certain generated files, datasets, and configs are not uploaded to GitHub directly.

However, for easy setup, we have compressed them into a single zip file included in this repository.

### Quick Setup for Developers:
1. Please **[Download dataset_and_env.zip](./dataset_and_env.zip)** located in this project folder.
2. Extract the contents.
3. Place all the extracted files directly inside their corresponding directories in the `backend/` folder!
   **Included files:**
   - `.env`
   - `traffic_accidents1.csv`
   - `max_frequency.joblib`
   - `model.joblib`
   - `server.log`
   - `services/__pycache__/supabase_service.cpython-313.pyc`
   - `utils/__pycache__/auth.cpython-313.pyc`
4. Run frontend (`npm run dev`) and backend app (`python backend/app.py`). Everything will work magically!
